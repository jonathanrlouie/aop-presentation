The examples have been tested with Idris 2 version 0.4.0.

For Nix users, if you have the experimental flakes feature enabled, you can simply run `nix develop` from the project root to enter a sandbox environment that comes with Idris 2 v0.4.0 and will let you try playing around with the examples.

Run `idris2 <ExampleFileName.idr>` to build an example and start the Idris2 REPL.
